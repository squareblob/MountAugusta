# Article II. Formation and Jurisdiction of Augustan Law

## A. Borders of the State of Mount Augusta

i. The borders of the State of Mount Augusta shall be outlined and defined by the office of the Mayor of Mount Augusta. Any proposal by the mayor to change the borders must be publicized on the subreddit in a post titled with "[Border Change]". The proposal may be contested by any eligible voter.

> a. To contest the proposed border change, a post titled with "[Contest]" must be made on /r/MtAugusta within 48 hours of the publication of the border proposal by the Mayor. This thread will be treated as a regular vote for a border change as outlined in II.
>
> b. If the border change proposal is not contested within 48 hours, the borders proposed by the Mayor will become the new official borders of the State of Mount Augusta.

ii. The borders of the State of Mount Augusta may be changed through a bill via the same process as any other bill, requiring 2/3 of the vote to become the new official boundaries of the State of Mount Augusta.

iii. The extension of the borders of the City of Mount Augusta shall not infringe upon existing land claims by other states, groups or individuals without official consent.

## B. Creation of new laws

i. New laws may be proposed by any eligible voters of Mount Augusta. Such proposals shall be subject to a popular vote to determine passage. A majority of at least two-thirds of all votes cast shall be needed for passage.

ii. No law may be created that targets a group or individual or that sets differing standards of behavior or punishment for a group or individual. No law may be applied retroactively, except for bills granting amnesty. Any law violating this section shall be invalid.

iii. Movements to repeal or amend any law may be proposed by any registered voter of the state of Mount Augusta. Such proposals shall be subject to a popular vote to determine passage. A majority of at least two-thirds of all votes cast shall be needed for passage. Amnesty bills, if passed, have their effects limited to the following. For previously criminal acts for which amnesty is granted:

> a. No new charges can be brought forward.
>
> b. Current charges in trial proceedings are dropped.
>
> c. Convictions where the sentence is in progress have their sentence reduced by the amount given in the verdict for the specific charges being granted amnesty, or by the minimum sentence related to that charge if unspecified in the verdict. If the maximum charge for other charges does not account for the remaining time in the sentence, the excess is discarded. If this reduces the remaining time in the sentence to zero days or less, the sentence ends immediately and the individual will be freed.
>
> d. Convictions where the sentence was completed are not affected; individuals who served these sentences cannot use their lawfully served sentence as a basis for grievances in legal proceedings.

## C. Law Conflicts

i. In the case of a conflict between two or more laws, elements of the Constitution take precedence over elements of the Criminal Code, which in turn take precedence over resolutions. In the event of conflicts between two laws of the same precedence level, the later law prevails. In the event of conflict between two laws passed simultaneously, the textually later clause takes precedence. If a clause of a law is self-contradictory, that clause is null and void. All laws are superseded by the Bill of Rights should a conflict be found between a law and the Bill of Rights.

# Article III. Enforcement of Augustan Law

## A. Detainment and Rights of the Accused

i. Anyone within Mount Augusta may arrest any individual who is about to commit or has commited a crime; given that there is reasonable suspicion to support this arrest, and may be held for no more than 7 days without a trial request (through a post in /r/mtaugustajustice containing "[Trial Request]" in the title, and the charges clearly described in the body of that post). Time spent pearled without a trial will be counted as time served.

ii. All persons who are arrested for allegedly committing an offense have the right:

> a. to remain silent;
> 
> b. to be informed promptly of their rights to a trial;
> 
> c. not to be compelled to make any confession or admission that could be used in evidence against that person;
> 
> d. to be brought before a court as soon as reasonably possible, to choose, and to consult with, a legal practitioner, and to be informed of this right promptly;

iii. The defendant in a trial shall know the time of and be able to attend their own trial and present evidence in their favor. If there is not sufficient evidence to prove guilt, the defendant shall be assumed innocent and there shall be no punishment or conviction. No individual may be tried more than once for the same instance of the same crime unless they call for a retrial or the previous trial was declared a mistrial. The defendant will have the right to have a translator present if applicable.

iv. Every accused person has a right to a fair trial, which includes the right ­ to be informed of the charge with sufficient detail to answer it; to have adequate time and facilities to prepare a defense; to have their trial begin and conclude without unreasonable delay; to be present when being tried; to choose, and be represented by, a legal practitioner, and to be informed of this right promptly; to have their pearl held by the court during proceedings.

v. No pearls shall be held within the borders of the State of Mount Augusta independently of its judicial system. If a foreign entity requests that a pearl be held within the borders of the State of Mount Augusta, that pearl is subject to the standards of Augustan law and the pearled individual must be given a trial just as if they had been pearled for an offense committed domestically. For the purposes of this trial, offenses committed abroad will be punishable in the same manner as offenses committed domestically.

vi. No person pearled by the State of Mount Augusta or turned over to the State of Mount Augusta shall have their pearl held in a location outside the borders of the State of Mount Augusta, excepting those who have first undergone the process of extradition.

viii. Any person pearled in Mount Augusta, other than when pearled as part of a sentence for a specific convicted crime, may ask a judge to be released. If the judge considers that the pearled person does not present a danger to the community, and is not likely to flee from the justice system, the judge may simply grant this request. If the judge considers that the defendant does not present a danger to the community, but does have a risk of fleeing from the justice system, the judge may grant a conditional release upon payment of a bail. The amount of bail is set by the judge in accordance to the risk of fleeing. Whenever that judge decides that the original flight risk is no longer relevant, he or she may return the bail again. If the released individual flees the justice system, in the opinion of the judge, the judge may use the bail as a bounty to secure their pearl again.

## B. Court Structure

i. The Augustan Court consists of three Judges.

ii. The position of Judge shall be an elected position, term set to three months.

> a. The Judge will have no power except the powers outlined in this Constitution.
> 
> b. The Judge will keep a detailed account of the trial, and run all court cases through /r/mtaugustajustice following the procedure outlined under Article III 
> Subsection C. If a case in handled in-game, a record must be posted on /r/mtaugustajustice.
> 
> c. The Judge will maintain composure, will be committed to impartiality, and will remove themselves from positions of official power in any foreign organization, nation, or other entity composed of multiple individuals.
> 
> d. A Judge may resign by posting their resignation publicly on /r/MtAugusta. The process to elect a new judge to fill the gap as described by Article I, Part B must begin with 14 days of a resignation post. The replacement will serve the remainder of the former Judge’s term.
> 
> e. A Judge must be a citizen of Mount Augusta, as described by Article I, Section E or as otherwise defined by law.
> 
> f. Judicial elections will occur once every month, with the three-month terms of each Judge being staggered. Mount Augusta’s first judicial election on any iteration of the map will be for all three Judges. The Judge with the highest amount of votes will maintain their term for three months, the next highest voted Judge will maintain their position for two months, and the third highest voted Judge will maintain their position for one month.

iii. Limitations of positions

> a. The Judges are subject to the approval of the citizenry, and are therefore open to immediate recall upon a passing recall vote
> 
> b. Judges cannot preside over trials in which they are either a defendant or plaintiff.
> 
> c. Judges must declare potential conflicts of interest. If the court, through /r/mtaugustajustice is petitioned by the defendant or the plaintiff, it is the responsibility of the other judges to determine if any potential conflict of interest is sufficient to remove impartiality of the presiding Judge, and any ruling of 2 or more Judges that a Judge cannot preside over a case due to conflict of interest is sufficient cause to prevent that Judge from presiding over the case.
> 
> d. In the case that all Judges are simultaneously either defendants, plaintiffs, or have a conflict of interest, it shall be the duty of the Mayor to adjudicate the trial. As highest arbitrator, there can be no appeal to such a trial, unless it should be declared a mistrial as per the process laid out in Article III, Part D, subpart ii.
> 
> e. Should the mayor and the judges all be plaintiffs, defendants, or have a conflict of interest in a trial, a temporary, impartial third party Judge must be voted in by two-thirds popular vote (following the rules outlined in Article I, Section B, part i), with the duty to preside over the trial only, after which they will cease to act as Judge.
> 
> f. As an exception to the above, if all members of Mt. Augusta are either Plaintiff or Defendant (such as People vs. defendant cases) then the current Judges may preside as normal, subject to these limitations.

## C. Trials

i. All parties shall have the opportunity to be present for the trial; by having access to the subreddit /r/mtaugustajustice.

ii. Proper decorum and respect for the court process is requested.

iii. Comments unrelated to the trial, not providing evidence, or expressing opinions as to guilt or innocence will be removed.

iv. Order of Trial

> a. Prosecution presents claim;
> 
> b. Defendant enters plea. Pleas will be Guilty, Not Guilty, No-contest;
> 
> c. Prosecution presents evidence, and calls witnesses;
> 
> d. Defense cross examination;
> 
> e. Defendant presents evidence, and calls witnesses;
> 
> f. Prosecution cross examination;
> 
> g. Prosecution closing statement;
> 
> h. Defendant closing statement;

> i. The judge of the case will decide guilt or innocence on the charges, as well as the amount of time to be served, as per the Mount Augusta Criminal Code;
> 
> j. Details of the trial and the judge’s determination must be posted publicly by the judge or the judge’s designee within 24 hours of the conclusion of the in game trial to /r/mtaugustajustice. The judge's posting of the verdict and outcome to the /r/mtaugustajustice subreddit shall complete the trial.

v. The plaintiff in a trial must be an alleged victim who suffered direct harm as a result of each charge of each crime in the trial. Those with general fear, anxiety, lowered property values, or other indirect harms due to a crime are not considered victims. Legal representatives may act on behalf of a victim.

vi. Where no victim(s) as described in (v) can be identified, such as crimes against the state as a whole, the Mayor and Judges (as of the time of the trial) shall be considered to be “victims” for the purposes of prosecution.

vii. If the prosecution or defense in a trial willfully neglects the trial unreasonably for 48 or more hours, the opposing party may petition the judge for a summary judgment. The judge is empowered to approve this request and issue a verdict, thereby ending the trial, or skip the neglectful party's turn; assuming the following conditions are met

> a. It is certain beyond reasonable doubt that the neglectful party is aware of the ongoing trial;
>
> b. It is reasonable to believe that the neglectful party was unaware that it was their turn;
>
> c. The petitioning party must provide evidence of the neglectful party's activity outside the trial or evidence of them intentionally neglecting the trial;
>
> d. The prosecution or defense may petition the judge for a time extension. The judge may grant this extension dependent on the reasoning provided.

## D. Retrials

i. If there is new evidence that suggests that an individual convicted of a crime is innocent, they may demand a retrial in which any new evidence may be presented. Such a trial shall be conducted in the same way as a regular trial. If the individual is not convicted in the new trial, they shall be cleared of the crime in question and all punishments shall be lifted immediately.

ii. Mistrials

> a. Following the completion of a trial, should the defendant, plaintiff or any resident feel that the ruling or process by which the trial was conducted violated the constitutional rights of either the defendant or the plaintiff or otherwise significantly undermined fair treatment or due process under the law, they may initiate a vote to declare it a mistrial. The request should be made in the trial's verdict thread should it still be accessible, otherwise a new thread should be created on /r/MtAugusta or /r/mtaugustajustice.
> 
> b. The vote will be held by the current Judges and the Mayor, excluding the individual who issued the verdict. Votes will be cast on the subreddit in reply to the mistrial request and will require greater than 50% of eligible votes in favour for the trial to be declared a mistrial. A lack of response within 48 hours will be recorded as a vote against the mistrial request. Sentences are assumed to remain valid during voting.
> 
> c. After a trial has been declared a mistrial, all proceedings of the trial and any rulings are declared invalid and a new trial is held. The individual who issued the verdict of the previous trial may not again determine the outcome of the retrial.

## F. Pardons

i. Pardons for any individual convicted of a crime within Mount Augusta may be granted by popular vote, with a majority of at least ¾ of all votes cast needed for the pardon. Any individual so pardoned shall not be tried again for the crime in question and all punishments shall be lifted immediately.

## G. Extraditions

i. Where claims exist outside of Mount Augusta's borders, the claimant may post a claim for the pearl on the Mount Augusta subreddit with evidence. A vote will be held among registered voters of Augusta. A two-thirds vote in favour of extradition is required, at which point the Mayor or Judges are responsible for the handing over of said pearl to the claimant.

ii. Only time spent pearled within Mount Augusta's borders shall count as time served for a Mt.Augustan criminal sentence.

# Article IV. Property

## A. Definition of property

i. Any structure or development of the land that does not conflict with existing ownership of property.

ii. A buffer is defined as a space of two (2) blocks extending out horizontally from the edge of any structure. The buffer shall be deemed part of the property. 

iii. Property ownership extends from sky to bedrock above and below all parts of the property.

iv. Anyone who places a structure which violates a law reliniquishes all property rights to the violating portion of that structure immediately, with only the following exception

> a. If the violation is only due to a pre-existing structure that is not obvious from the surface level.

v. In case of the exception defined above, the owner of the new structure shall be given notice and forty-eight hours to correct it before ownership is automatically relinquished and the offending aspects of the structure may be destroyed.

> a. Failure to properly notify the owner or wait the allotted forty-eight hours before altering the offending property will be a violation of Section 100.01 of the Augustan Criminal Code.
>
> b. A post on the Mount Augusta subreddit containing "[Building Violation]" in the title and including a clear picture of the existing structure, the offending structure, and a description of the offending portion, may serve as adequate notification under this law, should other means of notification be impractical or unsuccessful.
>
> c. If the offending aspects are only within the new structure's buffer, the owner forfeits their right to only that portion of their buffer.

## B. Property rights

i. Property may not be modified, moved, or destroyed without the consent of the property owner unless such action is the minimum required to bring such property within legal bounds.

ii. Property owners confer the right to map and world download all owned property in the State of Mount Augusta, given the actions are not used to reveal sensitive information, viz. information that cannot be gleaned from viewing the property with a vanilla client from a public space.

iii. Taking ownership of property within the State of Mount Augusta does not grant the power to release the property to other sovereign entities.

## C. Dereliction

i. Those seeking ownership of a property eligible for dereliction will:

> a. Place a sign at the property with their in-game name, the current date, and the word “Dereliction”, with the sign being unreinforced or stone-reinforced, and accessible for removal by the public. The placed dereliction sign is not to be considered the property of anyone.
>
> b. Make a post on the subreddit /r/MtAugusta containing [Dereliction] in the title, the coordinates of the sign, the coordinates of the property, and a link to one or more screenshots of the property, showing relevant structures and the dereliction sign.

iii. For 7 days after the post declaring intention of dereliction is made, any participant in Mount Augustan affairs as defined by the Constitution of Mount Augusta, Article I. Voting, A. Voting Eligibility and Registration, iii. Gaining voter registration, may object to the dereliction by commenting on the post stating their objection, and their reason for it.

iv. If the initiator of a dereliction believes an objection to their dereliction to be frivolous or unjustifiable, they may have the Judges review the objection. The Judges will then vote to sustain or overrule said objection, with a majority vote deciding the outcome. Should there be a tie amongst the vote of the Judges, the vote of the Mayor will count as the tiebreaker. If an objection is overruled, the objection is invalid. Derelictions are assumed not to have gone through while voting is underway.

v. Objections made by the owner of the property which is having dereliction attempted upon cannot be overruled.

vi. If an objection is made and not overruled, the dereliction sign must be removed within 14 days from the initial date of the r/MtAugusta dereliction post or 7 days after the objection was sustained by a vote of the Judges (and Mayor if applicable), whichever is later. If this is not done, the objection will not be valid.

vii. If there is no valid objection within the 7 day waiting period, the property which was the subject of dereliction proceedings, along with the structures and items within, will become the property of the initiator.

viii. If a property owner will have an extended absence from CivClassic or Reddit, both the posting of a sign on their property declaring this absence, or a post to r/MtAugusta specifying their property and declaring this absence, will exempt the posted property from dereliction for a period of 3 months.

# Article VII. Officially Recognized Flag and Holidays

## A. Flag Design

i. The flag of Mount Augusta shall consist of a blue rectangle with a red square in the top left corner or, if on a flagpole, on the top corner on the side touching the pole. The red square shall be of such a size that its side extends halfway across the smaller dimension of the flag.

## B. National Holidays

i. June 30th shall be known as the Day of Dan, in commemoration of the mayorship of ProgrammerDan.

ii. In recognition of his service to the city and his sacrifice against those menacing our beautiful Augusta, July 31st shall forever be Henry Draton Memorial Day. Suggested celebrations would be for all Augustans to place a hopper outside their home and to play violins softly as the sun sets. Of course all may celebrate the brilliant life of this glorious man however they wish.

iii. The day on which Mount Augusta is officially founded in CivCraft’s third iteration will be edited into this document, and will mark the date of Foundation Day (August 14th), a holiday to commemorate the perseverance of the Augustan people through three eras of CivCraft. 

iv. Further holidays may be recognized via a popular vote.
