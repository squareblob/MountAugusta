## Mount Augusta

Mount Augusta is a 7 year old city that has lived and thrived through multiple civcraft-style minecraft servers. 

> You can build a world but breathing life into it takes more than just blocks. It takes a choice between order and chaos, a choice between justice and tyranny.

Intertwined with this long history is the cities [constitution](https://old.reddit.com/r/mtaugusta/wiki/constitution) and the [subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/MtAugusta/) hosting it where anyone can submit bills to be voted on and added to the constitution. Despite this ability to change the constitution, in many areas awkward or simply grammatically and semantically incorrect segments persist, to speak nothing of more sweeping changes.  

With this repo editing the constitution should be easier than ever - fixing a typo only requires editing [Constitution.md](https://github.com/squareblob/MountAugusta/blob/master/Constitution.md) directly. Instead of a bill discussion and vote for each simple change of this sort, small non-controversial changes can be grouped together and voted upon at once. Discussion can occur directly on the github, exact changes and revision history can be viewed clearly.

### How to Edit 

Simply click on the document you wish to edit and press the pencil icon in the top right corner to propose changes. If you spot inconsistencies in constitution style refer or edit the [Constitution Style Guide](https://github.com/squareblob/MountAugusta/blob/master/Constitution%20Style%20Guide.md). It is helpful to specify in the edits description if you are intending to change the meaning and make a large change. These changes will be voted on in seperate bills from small fixes. 

### Considerations

* As this is not and does not aim to be the official platform of the Mount Augusta constitution, bills passed solely on the subreddit must be edited into this document in order to keep both documents in sync. This process can eventually be automated. 

* The Github and reddit markdowns differ and thus titles do not format properly. Eventually this too can be automated.

* Everything from small, single word changes to gigantic overhauls are welcome to be discussed and submitted here. It can be more helpful however to discuss and create changes relatively gradually and in collaboration with others.

* Anyone can paste the full source or a section of [Constitution.md](https://github.com/squareblob/MountAugusta/blob/master/Constitution.md) and submit it as a bill, helpfully including a link to the difference between constitution versions here in the repo. It is advised to wait until multiple small changes have accumulated and to split overhaul changes into their own bill or seperate bills.
