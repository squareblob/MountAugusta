For all : general markdown fixes (should not make much practicle viewing difference, but srtandarizes so markdown will work on other sites)

# Preamble & BoR Annotations
* Ratification date could mention the ratification date of first MtA constitution
* Make preamble and BoR intro a bit more inspired. (Nothing wrong with them at the moment but I think they could be slightly smoother and more interesting?)
* https://old.reddit.com/r/MtAugusta/comments/b5v6ou/bill_discussion_simplication_of_the_bill_of/ see and incorporate this


# Article 1

## A. Voting Eligibility and Registration [537 -> 338 (-37%)]

### Changes to i. Requirements for voter eligibility [107 -> 75 (-30%)]
* Changed order, added links, standardized format a bit. Should be essentially the same meaning...

### Changes to ii. Public record of voter registration [199 -> 147 (-26%)]
* (a.) Changed so a voter registration thread must always be present instead of only "prior to any election, or when called for by any citizen". The change reflects the current reality of voter registration threads. 
* (b.) Made shorter, second sentence still a bit awkward.
* (c.) Made less of a block of text with subsection (and thus more readable). Don't really like too layers of >> formatting though.
* (d.) Removed specifics of how sign must be maintained and replaced with only general goals (e.g. "publicly and easily viewable"). 
* (unlabeled section) Added as subsection to (d.)

### Changes to iii. Gaining voter registration [68 -> 29 (-57%)]
* (a.) Removed the need to fulfill eligibility requirements for full three days. Now you only must be eligible when posting image. This also makes it slightly easier to remember renewal times. Changed it to 'person' as citizen is redundant - it is already an eligibility requirement. 

### Changes to iv. Survivability of voter registration [55 -> 27 (-51%)]
* (a.) Changed 30 days after 'confirmation' to after 'posting' for we currently do not give written confirmation for every voter registration. (posting is perhaps still not specific enough). 
* (b.) merged into (a.). (Perhaps too short with loss of clarity :/ e.g. what does 'renewal' mean)

### Changes to v. Arbitration of voter eligibility [83 -> 30 (-64%)]
* (a.) Moved section of mayor as final arbiter and taking judge duties when no judges to mayor sections. This is a rare enough event it can be centralized in a single location imo and still maintain clarity.
